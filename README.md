Following algorithms and data structures are visualized:
* Bubble/Selection/Quick Sort
* Double/Linear Hashing, Linear Probing
* Breadth/Depth First Search, Kruskal and Dijkstra Algorithms
* Binary Search Tree, B+ Tree, Binary Min Heap, Heap Sort

To start the visualization just open the 'index.html' in the 'htmls' folder
